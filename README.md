# What is a business exchange group.

### First lets know, what is is not
-  It's not a startup group, although we support all types of startups, but still this group is for established businesses. That simply means it's preferred to do real business than working on ideas. For such startup ideas you will have different groups in lisbon. So whatever you do here will generate some sort of revenue for you. So no fundraising, because the best money you can earn is the money from your satisfied customers. 
- It's not a group for non business discussion. So please share only the business opportunities here.
- It's not a group with any commercial intent. It's a completely voluntary group. Hence it's never gonna be like groups such as BNI, toastmasters etc.. And we do not have any commercial plans. So its always free.  
   
   
## Why did we start this group?
We all have seen incredible skills. Some of us are exceptionally talented in stuff like design, tech or maybe organization and management. Some of us have already established their organization or some of us have great success as solopreneur. At the same time some of us are really good in sales, and also have lots of prospective clients. but we all face three major challenges
1. We  have talent but could not find a potential market for it. OR we have a market but could not find the right talent to close the deal.
- Answer: Creating the right balance of people with opportunity and talented product or service provider in the group. To put  it in simple words, we keep introducing people from either the talent side or the demand side, as and when needed in the group. This also means simply post if you have any business requirement.

2.  We have hit the plateau  of our business capacity looking for  further expansion opportunities.
-  Knowledge and Collaboration is the answer to this challenge. For solopreneur this challenge is more clearly visible.
Simple test: If you are not making money while you are sleeping or on your vacation, you are not making money. Faster collaboration, with appropriate legalization and making business processes as standard operating procedure through knowledge will lead to great scalability.   

3. We are trying to enter into new markets, sometimes geographically or industry wise. But we face lots of trouble entering it. 
- Answer: Diversity is the answer to this question, diversity in terms of different nationality, diversity in terms of different types of industry sectors, diversity in different age groups etc etc. is the key essence of this group. So don't hesitate to ask any business related question. 

The goal of this group is aligned to answer all these problems such that you will achieve unprecedented returns on your efforts.
